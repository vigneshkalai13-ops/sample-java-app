# Java Programmings Overview

## 📌 What is Java Programming?

Java is a **high-level, object-oriented programming language** used to build secure, scalable, and platform-independent applications.

Java follows the principle:

**Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA)**  
This means Java programs can run on any operating system (Windows / Linux / Mac) using the JVM (Java Virtual Machine).

## 🚀 Features of Java

- **Platform Independent** – runs on JVM  
- **Object-Oriented** – uses classes and objects  
- **Secure** – strong security model  
- **Robust** – automatic memory management  
- **Fast** – JIT compiler improves performance  
- **Large Community Support**

### 5. Big Data Technologies
Hadoop, Spark, Kafka, and Cassandra are written in Java/Scala.

### 6. DevOps Tools
Popular DevOps tools like **Jenkins**, **Maven**, **Tomcat**, **ElasticSearch**, and **Kafka** use Java.

# Apache Maven – Overview & Installation on Linux

## 📌 What is Maven?

**Maven** is a build automation and project management tool for Java applications.  
It uses a configuration file called **`pom.xml` (Project Object Model)** to manage:

- Project structure  
- Dependencies  
- Compilation  
- Packaging (JAR/WAR)  
- Testing  
- Deployment (install, deploy)  

Maven follows **Convention Over Configuration**, meaning a standard project structure is used everywhere.
